# CSCI 176 – Parallel Processing  
**Fresno State | Computer Science**

This repository contains my coursework, programming assignments, and experiments for **CSCI 176: Parallel Processing** at **California State University, Fresno**.

The course focuses on the principles and practice of parallel programming, including shared-memory and distributed-memory systems. Topics emphasize performance, scalability, synchronization, and real-world parallel programming APIs.

## Course Overview

CSCI 176 introduces the fundamentals of parallel computing, covering both hardware and software perspectives. Key goals include:

- Understanding why parallelism is essential in modern computing
- Learning how to design and analyze parallel algorithms
- Writing correct, efficient, and scalable parallel programs
- Evaluating performance using speedup, efficiency, and scalability metrics

---

## Topics Covered

- Parallel architectures (SIMD, MIMD, multicore systems)
- Shared-memory vs. distributed-memory models
- Performance metrics (speedup, efficiency, Amdahl’s Law)
- Synchronization and concurrency issues
- Load balancing and scalability
- Parallel program design techniques

---

## Technologies & Tools

This repository may include implementations using:

- **C / C++**
- **MPI (Message Passing Interface)**
- **POSIX Threads (Pthreads)**
- **OpenMP**
- Linux-based development tools (e.g., `gcc`, `mpicc`)
